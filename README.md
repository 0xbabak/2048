### Introduction
Welcome to the 2048 game implemented in Python! This simple console-based game allows you to play the classic 2048 game by shifting tiles in four directions â€“ up, down, left, and right. The game continues until the player decides to quit.

### Features
Random Matrix Generation: The game starts with a randomly generated square matrix of a given size.
Tile Shifting: Use the 'W', 'A', 'S', and 'D' keys to shift tiles up, left, down, and right, respectively.
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of your current score.
High Score: Your highest score is displayed at the beginning of each game.
How to Play
Run the script in a Python environment.
Press any key to start playing.
Enter the size of the game area (e.g., 4 for a 4x4 matrix).
Use the keys 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' to shift tiles in the corresponding directions.
Continue playing until you decide to quit by pressing 'Q'.
### Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy library (install using pip install numpy)

### Instructions for Running
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory containing the script.
Run the script using a Python interpreter:
''' python 2048_game.py '''

### Notes
Make sure you have the NumPy library installed (pip install numpy) before running the script.
The high score is displayed at the beginning of each game. It will persist until you close the script.
Press 'Q' to exit the game at any time.
Enjoy playing 2048! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue or contribute to the project. Have fun!
